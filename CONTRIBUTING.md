## Code conventions and housekeeping

None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help

- Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is for.
- Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files in the project)
- Add yourself as an `@author` to the `.java` files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).
- Add some Javadocs
- Add unit tests that cover any new or modified functionality
- Whenever possible, please rebase your branch against the current main (or other target branch in the main project).
- When writing a commit message please follow [these conventions][4].
  Also, if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-nnn` at the end of the commit message (where nnn is the issue number).
